<h4>Bikeshare Project...
  In this project, I have used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Software Needed
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime(opens in a new tab) or Visual Studio Code(opens in a new tab)
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Git Bash on Windows).


Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I have used the data provided by Motivate(opens in a new tab), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I have compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</h4>
